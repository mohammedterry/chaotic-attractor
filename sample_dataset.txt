The homestead feels slightly abandoned, 
the facade -especially the roof- in dire need of an overhaul.
The hour hand of an old, electric clock shifts slightly, 
marking six a.m.  
A soft alarm sounds.  
Beneath the blankets, a body shifts, 
a weathered hand reaching out 
to silence the antique. 
A beat... 
a sigh... 
a groan... 
and JOHN WICK -early sixties, salt-and-pepper hair, three-day beard, former boxer, former military, tired, beaten down, and at wit’s end- sits up, 
staring unblinkingly out at the day. 
A beat... 
and he stands, 
donning a weathered robe and a pair of slippers.  
John stuffs his hands into his pockets...
...and shuffles down the corridor, 
the walls overflowing with family pictures, 
each badly in need of dusting.  
They catalogue a long and healthy life with his wife, Norma; 
the pictures presenting a time line of sorts.  
No children, yet sheer, unadulterated happiness.
As John makes his way through his home, 
we can see that it is cluttered and unorganized.  Dirty, in fact, 
as if it hasn’t been cleaned in months.
John opens the door, 
retrieves the newspaper, 
closes, 
and locks the door behind him, 
without giving the outside so much as a glance.
John unceremoniously tosses the newspaper onto the table, 
opens a cupboard, 
and measures out a couple of tablespoons of Folgers Coffee into an old percolator. 
As it begins to bubble, 
John open the fridge, 
studies its contents for a moment or two, 
and then closes it, 
abandoning the thought of breakfast. 
He pours himself a cup of coffee 
and sits at the table.  
The newspaper is ignored.  
He drinks in silence for a long, dark, brooding moment, 
the loneliness almost unsettling. 
Suddenly, the phone on the wall RINGS. 
John lowers his cup, 
staring at the device, 
his eyes tired.  
A beat... 
and he stands, 
walking slowly 
to answer it. 
This is John. 
As he listens to the voice on the other end, 
John remains still... stoic. 
(whispers) Ok. 
John hangs up the phone 
and returns to the table, 
sinking slowly down into his chair. 
A long beat... 
...and John begins to weep, 
his hands trembling 
as he lowers his face in excruciating, utter, and complete sorrow. 
Having shaved 
and showered, 
wearing an old -but well-fitted- gray suit, 
John pushes open the garage door... 
...to reveal a legend 
in dire need of a total overhaul: a black, 1969 FORD MUSTANG ‘BOSS 429’.
A smile plays at his lips 
as John walks into the garage, 
running a hand along the chassis, 
desperately in need of a wash and wax.  
Behind him, the wall is lined with tools: a mechanic’s dream enclave. 
John enters
and closes the door behind him. 
John takes a moment 
to breath it in:  
he loves this car... 
although he hasn’t taken very good care of it as of late.  
A beat... 
and he slips the key into the ignition, 
twisting it, 
the motor coughing to life, 
the exhaust pipe belching black smoke.
The vehicle pulls out of the garage, 
stalls briefly, 
come back to life, 
puttering on down the road.
A soft rain begins to fall.
Carrying a humble bouquet of yellow daisies, 
John slowly makes his way down the eerily empty corridor. 
He pauses before a picture on the wall, 
glancing at his reflection upon the glass. 
He takes a deep breath, 
exhales, 
and enters a room.
John slowly approaches the figure 
lying in bed: 
surrounded by machinery, 
accompanied by the soft sounds of technology. 
He removes the wilted daisies from the vase, 
tosses them in the trash, 
and replaces them with fresh ones. 
He pulls over a chair, 
reaches out, 
and takes Norma’s hand:  
she is comatose, 
her breathing synthetic... 
so many machines... 
so many wires, tubes, and monitors. 
We never see her face:  just her silhouette. 
He holds her hand for a long moment in heavy silence.
Behind him, the DOCTOR -of a similar age to John- enters, 
placing a hand on John’s shoulder. 
John lowers his head, 
and nods.  
With a bit of effort, he stands, 
staring down at her for a long moment, 
never once releasing his grip, 
and leans over 
to kiss her on the forehead. 
JOHN ...it had to be you... 
...be seein’ ya’... 
A beat... 
and John nods. 
The doctor turns off the machine; 
lights dim, 
the room settles into silence, 
and Norma’s body grows still. 
The Doctor leaves John 
to be alone with his wife. 
(whispers) Be seein’ you. 
John pulls into the building... 
...and sits behind the wheel for a long moment... 
...his eyes unblinking... 
...so very alone...
John stands before the wall of pictures, statuesque 
as he studies them... unmoving... 
And then, he snaps; 
his hands gnarled into first, 
roaring with rage 
as he punches the pictures, 
ripping them from the wall, 
tossing them aside, 
eventually collapsing into a heap, out of breath, 
his knuckles bleeding. 
A long beat... 
and he chuckles softly, 
pulling himself to his feet. 
Unlike the rest of the house, this space is pristine 
and organized: 
one half designated as an impressive wood shop, 
the other an office space with a lazy boy recliner and tube television. 
John sits at his desk with a pencil in hand, a pad of paper before him, 
thinking. 
A long beat... 
and he sighs with a smile, 
placing the pencil upon the pad 
before sliding them both aside. 
John unscrews the cap off the bottle of scotch 
and pours himself a healthy dose.  
He opens his desk drawer, 
reaches into the back, 
and finds an old pack of cigarettes, half-empty.  
He taps one from, 
places it between his lips, 
and lights it, 
taking a deep pull. 
He holds it, 
and exhales, 
his body relaxing.  
He finishes his drink along with the cigarette, 
pours himself another... 
...and then opens a BOTTLE OF PILLS 
(The label reading NORMA WICK and OXYCONTIN), 
pouring them into a small mound upon the desk.  
He stares at them for a long moment... 
...before selecting one, 
studying it, 
sighing and
A KNOCK AT THE FRONT DOOR. 
John freezes, 
not sure 
as to how best to proceed. 
A beat... 
and someone KNOCKS a second time. 
John sighs, 
drops the pill back onto the mound, 
and walks upstairs.
A DELIVERY WOMAN waits for him on the doorstep.  
John opens the door. 
John Wick? 
Yes? 
She hands him a clipboard and a pen.
Sign here, please. 
In a daze, John signs the clipboard 
and hands it back to her. 
And the pen? 
Oh.  Sorry. 
John hands her the pen. 
Here you go! 
The Delivery Woman hands him a card and a PLASTIC CASE by the handle 
which he takes without looking. 
Have a good day. 
John nods, 
and -as she takes off- 
heads back inside.
John closing the door behind him... 
...and is startled by a small BARK. 
A beat... 
and he looks down 
to find that 
he is actually holding a small PET CARRIER.  
He lifts it 
to look inside:  
the face of a young, tri-colored (black, white, and brown), CHORGI (half-Corgi, half-Chihuahua) looks out at him, 
her tail wagging fiercely. 
She barks again, 
and John lowers it, confused.
Holding the envelope in his hands, 
John sits across from the carrier 
which he has set upon the table.  
Inside, the Chorgi lies 
with paws crossed,
studying him, 
tilting her head from side to side. 
A beat... 
and John opens the letter.  
The card inside is simple; 
white with a single DAISY drawn upon it. 
John smiles, 
instantly knowing who it is from, 
running a thumb along the face of the flower.  
He hesitates, 
but opens the card.
Dear, John.  If you have received this, then 
I have not survived the surgery.  
(a beat, then) 
I am so, so sorry. 
Tears begin to well in John’s eyes. 
But you’ve still got a life ahead of you, 
and I intend for you to live it.  
You may think you’ve hidden things from me, 
but you haven’t.  
I know you.  
And should this reach you in time -
which I pray it has- 
I beg you, 
I implore you, 
to stop.  
To think.  
To live. 
(a beat, then) 
I love you, John.  With all my heart.  
Our years were good.  The best, in fact.  
But I’d rather see you later... than sooner... 
your best friend... Norma. 
John lowers the letter, 
wipes the tears from his cheeks, 
and stares at the puppy... 
chuckling. 
Well played, Norma. 
John reaches across, 
and flicks open the pet carrier. 
(mutters) Well played. 
The Chorgi scrambles out of the cage 
and studies him; 
sniffing, 
licking, 
and barking. 
So... you gotta’ name? 
John checks the collar 
to find a DAISY-SHAPED medallion 
which reads Moose. 
(a beat, then) 
Seriously? 
As if in reply, 
Moose barks.
All right, then...  
(smiles) 
...Moose, it is.
